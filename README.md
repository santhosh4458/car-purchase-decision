## 📊 Problem Statement

We aim to predict whether a customer is likely to purchase a car (`Purchased = 1`) or not (`Purchased = 0`) based on the following features:

- `Age`: Age of the customer
- `EstimatedSalary`: Estimated annual income of the customer
- `Purchased`: Target variable (1 = purchased, 0 = not purchased)
